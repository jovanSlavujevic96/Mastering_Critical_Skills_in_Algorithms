/***
* Problem #5: LeetCode 1921 - Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters
*
* You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of n monsters. You are
* given a 0-indexed integer array dist of size n, where dist[i] is the initial distance in kilometers of the
* i-th monster from the city.
*
* The monsters walk toward the city at a constant speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an
* integer array speed of size n, where speed[i] is the speed of the i-th monster in kilometers per minute.
*
* You have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a single monster. However, the wapon takes one minut
* to charge. The weapon is full charged at the very start.
*
* You lose when anu monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the wapon
* is fully charged, it counts as a loss, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.
*
* Return the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or n if you can eliminate
* all the monsters before they reach the city.
*
* int eliminateMaximum(vector<int>& dist, vector<int>& speed);
*
* Example 1:
*   Input: dist = [1,3,4], speed = [1,1,1]
*   Output: 3
*   Explanation:
*
*   In the beginnning, the distances of the monsters are [1,3,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
*   After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,2,3]. You eliminate the second monster.
*   After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,X,2]. You eliminate the third monster.
*   All 3 monsters can be eliminated.
*
* Example 2:
*   Input: dist = [1,1,2,3], speed = [1,1,1,1]
*   Output: 1
*   Explanation:
*
*   In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,1,2,3]. You eliminate the first monster.
*   After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,1,2], so you lose.
*   You can only eliminate 1 monster.
*
* Example 3:
*   Input: dist = [3,2,4], speed = [5,3,2]
*   Output: 1
*   Explanation:
*
*   In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [3,2.4]. You eliminate the first monster.
*   After a minute, the distances of the monster are [X,0,2], so you lose.
*   You can only eliminate 1 monster.
*
* Can you code such that there are no double conversion (e.g.division)
* or modulus operator ?
